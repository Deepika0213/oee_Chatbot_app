# 🤖 OEE Chatbot for Biscuit Packaging Devices

An interactive GenAI-powered Streamlit application that helps monitor and analyze the **Original Equipment Efficiency (OEE)** of packaging devices deployed in a biscuit manufacturing facility.
Designed with a **ChatGPT-style conversational interface**, this app allows users to easily query and visualize the performance of specific devices.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In a modern biscuit manufacturing facility, packaging devices are equipped with IoT sensors that generate large volumes of operational data.
Manually calculating OEE for individual machines is time-consuming and prone to error. 

**Objective:**  
Develop a web-based GenAI application that allows users to calculate and display the **OEE (%)** of selected packaging devices based on:

- 📌 Device ID  
- 🌍 Location  
- 🗓️ Month or specific date
